(The important thing here is that each $z_j$ has *two possible values*. By convention, we choose those values to be $\\pm 1$). The QAOA is a general-purpose algorithm whose goal is to produce an assignment of the $z_j$ that gives a relatively low value of $C(z)$.

To be more specific, let's agree that the value of $z_j$ corresponds to the measurement outcome of the Pauli-$Z$ operator on the $j$th qubit.

        "The Ising Model with transverse field replaces the $\\sum h_i Z_i$ term with a $\\sum h_i X_i$ term. Can we use the QAOA here as well? What are the differences? This is no longer a classical problem: in general the ground state will now be a superposition of elements of the computational basis. Can you make a circuit that prepares a state close to the ground state?"
